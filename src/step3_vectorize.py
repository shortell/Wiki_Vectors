1. read the data from data/companies/sanitized.csv

2. For each companies sanitized text send it to an embedding model to 
create a high dimensional vector embedding (Currently using Open AI API

3. Store each vector embedding in the data/embeddings directory 
(file extension may change) as well as identifying information like 
the id and symbol
